# LLM Tokenziers in C++ (1): Unicode Regexp

[LLM Tokenizers in C++ (0): Port from Python](https://github.com/wangkuiyi/gpt2cpp/wiki/LLM-Tokenzier-in-C---(0):-Port-from-Python)

## Regexp for Unicode

The first step of BPE tokenizing is to split the text into candidate tokens. The class `GPT2Tokenizer` uses Python’s regexp package to do so.

The following regexp defines a candidate token.

```
self.pat = re.compile(
  r"""'s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\p{L}+| ?\p{N}+| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+""")
```

With the triple-quote, the authors do not have to escape the quote mark. The prefix `r` before the triple-quote means the string is treated as a [raw string](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4780104/724872), so all other eescape codes will be ignored.

The general structure of this regexp is a sequence of sub-regexp’s separated by the logical-or mark, `|`. The first few sub-regexp’s correspond to commonly-used subwords such as `'ve`.

`\p{L}`, according to [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14891168/724872), mean a unicode letter. Similarly, `\p{N}` is a number. `\s` means a space character, which could be a space, a tab, or a newline. `\S` mean non-space character.

So, ` ?\p{L}+` means a sequence of one or more letters prefixed with or without a whitespace. This represents a “word”. Similarly, ` ?\p{N}+` represents a number without signs or the dot. 

`[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]` means a character which is not a space, a letter, or a number. This leaves us the puctunations. Therefore, ` ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+` is a sequence of successive punctuators prefixed with or without a whitespace.

`\s+` means one or more spaces.

`\s+(?!\S)` uses the [look-ahead assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Assertions) `(?!...)`. It matches one or more spaces followed by, but excluding, a non-space character.  With the existence of this sub-regexp, the successive of N spaces followed by a word is recognized as two tokens -- `\s+(?!\S)` matches the first token consisting of N-1 spaces, and ` ?\p{L}+` matches the second token consisting the last space and the word.  The purpose is to have the second word recognized as a token with a leading space, which indicates that the word is not the first word of a sentence. If we remove `\s+(?!\S)`, the N spaces will be recognized as the first token, and the word as the second one, without the leading space.

**Unfortunately, re2 [does NOT support](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) look-ahead.**

> (?!re)	before text not matching re (NOT SUPPORTED)

**This will slightly change the idea into that the successive two or more spaces separate sentences, but not words.**

## Unicode Regexp in C++

`[std::regex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex)` does not accept Unicode regexp `\p{L}` or `\p{N}`. If we do so, the progrma will abort with the
`error_escape` and the message

>the expression contains an invalid escaped character or a trailing escape


This seems [a known problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38002322/724872), and the workaround is `boo`s`t::wregex`. Unfortunately, Boost is not part of the iOS SDK and I do not want to bring it in as a dependency of my Xcode project.  Moreover, according to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38543269/724872),

>The Boost.Regex documentation explicitly states that there's no support for Unicode-specific character classes when using boost::wregex. If you want this functionality, you'll need to build Boost.Regex with ICU support enabled then use the boost::u32regex type instead of boost::wregex.

No! I do not want to build Boost from source code because it is huge.

I then remembered several years ago, I read Russ Cox’s great notes about doing [regular expression the right way](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/) and his work [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2).

RE2 is small. It [supports Unicode regexps](https://github.com/google/re2/blob/b025c6a3ae05995660e3b882eb3277f4399ced1a/re2/testing/re2_test.cc#L1383-L1409).  More importantly, I can build it using CMake for both my macOS and iOS (Simulator)!  The following commands builds RE2 for the host.

```bash
cmake -B b -S . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=b/install
cmake —build b —target install
```

The following commands builds RE2 for iOS Simulator. You can change `iphonesimulator` into `iphones` to make it build for iOS devices.

```bash
cmake -B build-ios -S . \
      -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="$(xcodebuild -version -sdk iphonesimulator  Path)" \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 \
      -DCMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED=YES \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build-ios/install

cmake --build build-ios --target install
```

## Side-by-Side

The following Python code is copy-n-pasted from the Transformers’ tokenzier repository.

```python
import regex as re

pat = re.compile(
  r"""'s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\p{L}+| ?\p{N}+| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]+|\s+(?!\S)|\s+""")

def f(text):
  for token in re.findall(pat, text):
    print(f"token=\"{token}\"")

f("we'd  see   you say 世界你好真实好的很啊")
```

The output is as the following.

```
token="we"
token="'d"
token="  "
token="see"
token="   "
token="you"
token=" say"
token=" 世界你好真实好的很啊"
```

The following is the corresponding C++ code.

```c++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <re2/re2.h>
#include <re2/stringpiece.h>

int main() {
  std::string w;
  std::string text = "we'd  see   you say 世界你好真实好的很啊";
  re2::StringPiece input(text);

  RE2 re("('s|'t|'re|'ve|'m|'ll|'d| ?\\p{L}+| ?\\p{N}+| ?[^\\s\\p{L}\\p{N}]+|\\s+\\(?!\\S\\)|\\s+)");
  assert(re.ok());  // compiled; if not, see re.error();

  std::string var;
  int value;
  while (RE2::FindAndConsume(&input, re, &w)) {
    std::cout << "token=\"" << w << "\"" << std::endl;
  }
}
```

The following command builds it and links the RE2 static libarary.

```bash
clang++ -std=c++20 b.cc \
 -I ~/w/re2/b/install/include \
 -L ~/w/re2/b/install/lib -lre2 -o b
```

The output is identical to the above from the Python code.
